## üîπ 1. What is _Backtracking_?

### Answer

**Backtracking** is an algorithmic technique that uses a **depth-first search** approach to systematically build candidates for solutions. Each potential solution is represented as **nodes** in a **tree structure**.

If a particular pathway does not lead to a valid solution, the algorithm **reverts** or "backtracks" to a previous state. This strategy ensures a thorough exploration of the solution space by methodically traversing each branch of the tree.

### Practical Applications

1. **Sudoku Solvers**: Algorithms employ backtracking to determine valid number placements on the grid according to the game's rules.
 
2. **Boggle Word Finders**: Systems utilize backtracking to identify all valid words from a grid of letters in the Boggle game.

3. **Network Router Configuration**: Optimal configurations in complex networks, like routes and bandwidth allocations, are determined using backtracking.

4. **University Timetable Scheduling**: Backtracking aids in efficiently scheduling university courses, minimizing overlaps and optimizing resource usage.

5. **Interactive Storytelling in VR**: In virtual reality games, backtracking navigates and selects optimal story paths based on user decisions, ensuring a cohesive narrative.

### Code Example: N-Queens Problem

Place $N$ queens on an $N \times N$ chessboard such that none threaten another.

Here is the Python code:

```python
def is_valid(board, row, col):
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i] in [col, col - (row - i), col + (row - i)]:
            return False
    return True

def place_queen(board, row):
    n = len(board)
    if row == n:
        return True
    
    for col in range(n):
        if is_valid(board, row, col):
            board[row] = col
            if place_queen(board, row + 1):
                return True
            board[row] = -1  # Backtrack
    return False

def solve_n_queens(n):
    board = [-1] * n
    if place_queen(board, 0):
        print("Solution exists:")
        print(board)
    else:
        print("No solution exists.")

solve_n_queens(4)
```

The `is_valid` function evaluates queen placement validity, while `place_queen` recursively attempts to place all $N$ queens, backtracking when necessary.

## üîπ 2. Explain the _Depth-First Search_ (DFS) algorithm.

### Answer

**Depth-First Search** (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that's simpler and **often faster** than its breadth-first counterpart (BFS). While it **might not explore all vertices**, DFS is still fundamental to numerous graph algorithms.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Select a starting vertex, mark it as visited, and put it on a stack.
2. **Loop**: Until the stack is empty, do the following:
   - Remove the top vertex from the stack.
   - Explore its unvisited neighbors and add them to the stack.
3. **Finish**: When the stack is empty, the algorithm ends, and all reachable vertices are visited.

### Visual Representation

### Code Example: Depth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)
    
    return visited

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'G': {'A'},
    'E': {'B', 'G'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'F'}
}

print(dfs(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}
```

## üîπ 3. What is the difference between _Backtracking_ and _Recursion_?

### Answer

**Backtracking** often employs **recursion** to explore the vast space of possible solutions. However, not all recursive algorithms involve backtracking.

Think of **recursion** as the mechanism that enables a function to call itself, and **backtracking** as a strategy where you make a choice and explore the possibilities.

### Key Concepts

- **Recursion**: Utilizes a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking the main problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems. Recursive calls work towards solving these subproblems, relying on defined base cases for termination.

- **Backtracking**: Operates as an advanced form of recursion by building solutions incrementally. When a partial solution is deemed unsuitable, it "backtracks" to modify previous choices, ensuring an efficient traversal through the solution space.

### Common Applications

#### Recursion

- **Tree Traversals**: Visiting all nodes in a tree, like in binary search trees.
- **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Such as merge sort or quick sort.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems like the coin change problem by breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

#### Backtracking

- **Puzzle Solvers**: Solving games like Sudoku or crossword puzzles.
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Generating all permutations or combinations of a set.
- **Decision-making Problems**: Such as the knapsack problem, where decisions are made on whether to include items.

## üîπ 4. What is the difference between _Backtracking_ and _Exhaustive Search_?

### Answer

Both **Backtracking** and **Exhaustive Search** aim to find solutions to computational problems by exploring the **entire solution space**.

However, **backtracking** is more **selective**, often pruning parts of the search space based on certain criteria, making it potentially more efficient than an **exhaustive search** which systematically checks **every possible solution** without exception.

### Key Distinctions

- **Backtracking**: Incrementally creates solutions, evaluating viability at each step. Unviable paths lead the algorithm to revert and explore alternate paths.
- **Exhaustive Search**: Produces all possible solutions first and only then checks each one's viability.

### Example: Finding Subsets

Consider the task of finding subsets from $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ that sum up to 8.

- **Exhaustive Search** would evaluate **every possible subset** to find those that sum to 8. Valid subsets include $\{1, 2, 5\}, \{1, 3, 4\}, \{2, 3, 4\}$ among others.

- **Backtracking** begins with the first element and systematically adds subsequent elements. If the current subset's sum exceeds 8 or it's clear the sum cannot reach 8 with the remaining elements, it **backtracks** to try a different combination.

### Efficiency

- **Exhaustive Search**: Typically $O(2^n)$ time complexity and $O(n)$ space complexity‚Äîstraightforward but often less efficient.

- **Backtracking**: Generally offers improved time efficiency, with space complexity at $O(n)$.

### Practical Applications

#### Exhaustive Search

-  **Password Cracking**: For simple passwords, an exhaustive search or "brute force" method tries every possible combination until the correct one is found.
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (Small Datasets)**: For a limited number of cities, an exhaustive search can determine the shortest possible route by calculating every potential
- **Game Solving (Limited Possibilities)**: In games like Tic-Tac-Toe, exhaustive search can evaluate all possible moves to determine the best outcome.

#### Backtracking

- **Sudoku Solvers**: Efficiently filling out a Sudoku board by trying numbers in each cell and reverting if a contradiction is found.
- **Maze Solvers**: Finding a path from the start to the finish, trying different routes and backtracking when a dead-end is encountered.
- **Graph Coloring**: Assigning colors to vertices of a graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
